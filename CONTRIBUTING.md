Thanks for taking your time to contribute!

## Contributing quotes/messages

- Try to keep things short
- Puns are welcome
- Feel free to use emojis

### How to:

1. Edit the file `src/messages.ts`
2. Use template literal style string (like `` `hello` ``). This helps avoid escaping single and double quotes
3. Commit message: `[messages] add messages`

Please don't forget to add **trailing comma**, this will avoid a lot of noise in git diffs.
